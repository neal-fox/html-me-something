                    <h2>1985 Trek 620</h2>
                    <p>The first bike I purchased after moving to KC. I had been wanting to buy a touring bike to ride the Katy Trail, but hadn't really been shopping extensivley. This bike popped up on a facebook group focused on bikes for tall people. It looked to be my size and was for sale in KC, so I messaged the guy to test ride it. Ended up nerding out with the seller about bikes and possible compent builds for the Trek. This was the beginning of my bike building obsession. To this day we remain friends and update each other on bikes we are building.</p>

                    <h2>1991 Bridgestone XO2</h2>
                    <p>A buddy of mine expressed interest in doing an overnight bike tour on the Flint Hills trail in Kansas, but did not have a bike. Found this bike listed on Craigslist in his size, but in pretty beat up shape for $60. I recognized the bike had good bones and seemingly only cosmetic damage, so I purchased it planning to do my first complete bike overhaul. This would involve taking the entire bike apart, cleaning everything, then repacking the bottom bracket and hubs with new bearings and grease. A time consuming endeavor.</p>

                    <h2>1983 Raleigh Touring 18</h2>
                    <p>I had been planning on modernizing the Trek 620 with new components, but did not know what to do with the old components and would not have a bike to ride in the meantime while I rebuilt the 620. Luckily, this Raleigh appeared on Craigslist as a frame and fork only for $40. It is the same size as the 620, and was easy to swap over the components from the 620. A quick and dirty build that turned out really nice!</p>

                        <li>Made of Raleigh 555sl tubing, which is either rebranded Reynolds 501 or random meaningless marketing by Raleigh depending on who you ask</li>

                    <h2>1983 Specialized Stumpjumper</h2>
                    <p>This one was a bit of an impulse buy. I had seen some cool builds of old steel mountain bikes converted into fat tired, drop bar adventure bikes and had purchased another bike locally for this purpose. Problem was, being so tall, not many mountain bikes from that era were made in my size. This Stumpjumper popped up on ebay as a frame and fork only in a size that I didn't even know they made. It seemed like a perfect fit for what I had in mind and had some cool details, so I bid on the auction and won.</p>

                    <ul class="feat-list">
                        <li>The Stumpjumper was the first ever mass-production mountain bike sold. This one in particular being the second year of production</li>
                        <li>Whoever owned this frame previously brazed on extra water bottle cage mounts to the sides of the headtube and under the downtube. Stay Hydrated!</li>
                        <li>There is a rumor that Specialized reverse-engineered a frame from Tom Ritchey, a custom bike builder, for the Stumpjumper design, but Ritchey got word of this and sent them a frame with incorrect geometry</li>
